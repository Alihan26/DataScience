# Data Science Project: Hemorrhagic Stroke / Medical Imaging Predictions

This project focuses on predicting hemorrhagic stroke outcomes using medical imaging. The repository is organized to keep notebooks, scripts, figures, and data well separated.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Create the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**

   Open a terminal and run:

- Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`  
- Activate it:  
  - Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`  
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`  
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 

2. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook**

Navigate to the project folder and start Jupyter Notebook:

   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd DataScience
   jupyter notebook
  ```

## Project Structure

- **notebooks**  
  Contains the Jupyter notebook from our machine learning class. This notebook already has a complete pipeline set up for four different models and includes introductory code that can serve as inspiration.

- **figures**  
  Holds all images generated by the scripts.

- **scripts**  
  Includes various project scripts. Notably, Julian's image processing script is available and can be shared freely.

- **docs**  
  (Documentation details to be added.)

- **data**  
  Contains all project data, organized into the following subfolders:
  - **external**
  - **interim**
  - **processed**
  - **raw**

- **environment.yml**  
  Specifies all project dependencies.
